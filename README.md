## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of integrating a Next.js frontend with a Node.js and Express backend to fetch data from MongoDB. The fetched data is then displayed on tables on the frontend using Next.js.

## Features

- Fetches data from MongoDB using Node.js and Express.
- Displays fetched data on tables via Next.js.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with your MongoDB details:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
```

**Note**: Ensure you never commit your `.env` file containing sensitive information to any public repository. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent this.
Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` and `your_database_name` with your actual MongoDB connection string and database name in the `.env` file.
If you're using Next.js, and you want to use environment variables for development purposes (i.e., variables that are only available in the development environment), you can use an `.env.local` file.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Create the `.env.local` File**: 
   - Navigate to the root directory of your Next.js project.
   - Create a file named `.env.local`.

2. **Add MongoDB Details**: 
   - Open the `.env.local` file using a text editor.
   - Add your MongoDB connection details:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` and `your_database_name` with the appropriate values.

3. **Using Environment Variables in Next.js**:
   - Once you've added your environment variables to `.env.local`, you can access them in your Next.js application using `process.env.MONGODB_URI` and `process.env.DATABASE_NAME`.

4. **Note on `.env.local`**: 
   - Remember that `.env.local` is meant for local development. This means the variables set in this file will only be available during development and will not be included in your production build. If you want to use environment variables in a production setting, you'd typically use a method that aligns with your deployment strategy (e.g., setting environment variables in your hosting platform or container).

Ensure that you never commit sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or any other secrets to version control. Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to your repository.


## Usage

1. Once the project is set up and your MongoDB details are correctly added to the `.env` file, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
2. You should see the data fetched from MongoDB displayed on tables on the webpage.
